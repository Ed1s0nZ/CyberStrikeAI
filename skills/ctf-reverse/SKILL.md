description: Provides reverse engineering techniques for CTF challenges. Use when the main job is to understand how a compiled, obfuscated, packed, or virtualized target works before exploiting or solving it, including binaries, APKs, WASM, firmware, custom VMs, bytecode, game clients, malware-like loaders, and anti-debug or anti-analysis logic. Do not use it when the vulnerability is already understood and the remaining task is exploitation; use pwn instead. Do not use it for pure web workflows, log or disk forensics, or standalone crypto problems unless reversing the implementation is the real blocker.

## When to Pivot

- If you already understand the binary and now need heap, ROP, or kernel exploitation, switch to `/ctf-pwn`.
- If the challenge is really about recovering deleted files, PCAP data, or disk artifacts, switch to `/ctf-forensics`.
- If the target is a web app and you are only reversing a small client-side helper script, switch to `/ctf-web`.
- If the binary implements a machine learning model and the challenge is about model attacks or adversarial inputs, switch to `/ctf-ai-ml`.
- If the reversed binary's core logic is a cryptographic algorithm or math problem, switch to `/ctf-crypto`.
- If the binary is a real malware sample with C2, packing, or evasion behavior, switch to `/ctf-malware`.
- If the challenge is a toy VM, encoding puzzle, or pyjail rather than a real binary, switch to `/ctf-misc`.

## Problem-Solving Workflow

1. **Start with strings extraction** - many easy challenges have plaintext flags
2. **Try ltrace/strace** - dynamic analysis often reveals flags without reversing
3. **Try Frida hooking** - hook strcmp/memcmp to capture expected values without reversing
4. **Try angr** - symbolic execution solves many flag-checkers automatically
5. **Try Qiling** - emulate foreign-arch binaries or bypass heavy anti-debug without artifacts
6. **Map control flow** before modifying execution
7. **Automate manual processes** via scripting (r2pipe, Frida, angr, Python)
8. **Validate assumptions** by comparing decompiler outputs (dogbolt.org for side-by-side)

## Quick Wins (Try First!)

```bash
# Plaintext flag extraction
strings binary | grep -E "flag\{|CTF\{|pico"
strings binary | grep -iE "flag|secret|password"
rabin2 -z binary | grep -i "flag"

# Dynamic analysis - often captures flag directly
ltrace ./binary
strace -f -s 500 ./binary

# Hex dump search
xxd binary | grep -i flag

# Run with test inputs
./binary AAAA
echo "test" | ./binary
```

## Initial Analysis

```bash
file binary           # Type, architecture
checksec --file=binary # Security features (for pwn)
chmod +x binary       # Make executable
```

## Memory Dumping Strategy

**Key insight:** Let the program compute the answer, then dump it. Break at final comparison (`b *main+OFFSET`), enter any input of correct length, then `x/s $rsi` to dump computed flag.

## Decoy Flag Detection

**Pattern:** Multiple fake targets before real check. Look for multiple comparison targets in sequence with different success messages. Set breakpoint at FINAL comparison, not earlier ones.

## GDB PIE Debugging

PIE binaries randomize base address. Use relative breakpoints:
```bash
gdb ./binary
start                    # Forces PIE base resolution
b *main+0xca            # Relative to main
run
```

## Comparison Direction (Critical!)

Two patterns: (1) `transform(flag) == stored_target` — reverse the transform. (2) `transform(stored_target) == flag` — flag IS the transformed data, just apply transform to stored target.

## Common Encryption Patterns

- XOR with single byte - try all 256 values
- XOR with known plaintext (`flag{`, `CTF{`)
- RC4 with hardcoded key
- Custom permutation + XOR
- XOR with position index (`^ i` or `^ (i & 0xff)`) layered with a repeating key

## Quick Tool Reference

# Radare2
r2 -d ./binary     # Debug mode
aaa                # Analyze
afl                # List functions
pdf @ main         # Disassemble main

# Ghidra (headless)

```
